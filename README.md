mint-waxed : restful resume service
===================================

REST
----

This project implements a REST web service which serves my resume information.  The web service was built using the simple and powerful [C2Serve framework.](http://www.c2serve.eu/c2s-htdocs/overview.html).
I am not affiliated with C2Serve in any way, and discovered it via a link in [Wikipedia.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_service_frameworks) at the outset of this project.

Database
--------

I chose to use [Mongo DB](http://www.mongodb.org/) because it was new to me, and had a well-documented C++ API.  Its BSON interface also dovetailed nicely with the web service.


IDE
---

You may be curious why I chose C++ and which IDE I used.  The reasons are simple, really.  I have been working in a Java shop for the last three years, and not coding C++ at all.  I didn't want my skills
to get too rusty and I thought C++ would present a more creative solution to the reader.  I chose to try QT Creator as my IDE.  I have never used it before this project, but have become very familiar with it
these last couple of weeks.  My OS is Fedora 17 x86_64.


Acknowledgements
----------------

Thank you to the kind folks at C2Serve, MongoDB, QT, JQuery, QUnit and Fedora for all their hard work on these valuable open-source products.
